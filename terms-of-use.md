By your use of the Services you agree to these Terms and Conditions, and you certify that you are 18 years old or older and are able and competent to agree to and comply with these Terms and Conditions. The Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18.

PEAK reserves the right to refuse service and/or prohibit or terminate access to the Services, in whole or in part, for any or no reason, at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice to you. Further, your breach of these Terms and Conditions may jeopardize your continued use of the Services and may result in the cancellation of your account, among other consequences.

THE USE OF ANY ROBOT, SPIDER, OR OTHER AUTOMATIC DEVICE OR SOFTWARE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. IN THE EVENT WE REASONABLY DETERMINE THAT ANY ACTION OR ATTEMPTED ACTION WAS MADE BY OR THROUGH USE OF ANY ROBOT OR OTHER AUTOMATIC DEVICE OR SOFTWARE, WE HAVE THE RIGHT, IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TO DENY OR CANCEL ANY SUCH ACTION OR ACCOUNT.

BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AGAINST PEAK IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE “[**ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER; JURY TRIAL WAIVER; ENFORCEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS; GOVERNING LAW**](#arbitration)” SECTION BELOW AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO ACT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 

## MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

PEAK reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update, or modify these Terms and Conditions simply by posting such addition, change, update, or modification on the Services. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Services. We suggest that you check these Terms and Conditions periodically for changes.

## YOUR PRIVACY

## YOUR ACCOUNT

If you create an account on the Services, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and password, and for protecting and restricting access to such information.

PEAK reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without notice to you, to terminate your account and/or to restrict access to all or part of the Services for any reason, including, without limitation, for extended periods of inactivity. 

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS 

PEAK endeavors to be accurate when describing and displaying products on the Services. However, items may occasionally be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable (for example, due to delays with respect to updating the Services or inventory databases). Certain measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. The particular technical specifications and settings of your computer and its display could affect the accuracy of its display of the colors of products offered on the Services. As a result, and as set forth in the “[**DISCLAIMERS**](#disclaimers)” section below, PEAK does not and cannot guarantee the accuracy, reliability, currency or completeness of the information on the Services, including prices, images, specifications, and indications of availability. PEAK reserves the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

## SUBMISSIONS

While PEAK appreciates your comments and is happy to answer your questions about our products, our services, and our company, we generally do not accept ideas, know-how, inventions or suggestions for products and services (“**Submissions**”). This is for your protection and for ours, and to avoid misunderstanding about the origin of Submissions between you and PEAK. In the event that you provide any Submissions, whether in the form of feedback or otherwise, any such Submissions, and any remarks, graphics, or other information provided by you by any means, including through the Services, email, any contact functionality on the Services, or otherwise, is and will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and may be used by PEAK for any purpose (for which purpose, but submitting such items, you grant PEAK a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, sublicensable (through multiple levels), royalty-free right and license) except to the extent that such contains or constitutes personal information, which is subject to the guidelines established in our Privacy Notice. [Insert Hyperlink.] 

ENFORCEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS; EQUITABLE RELIEF 
You acknowledge and agree that the terms contained in this Terms and Conditions are reasonable and necessary, and that your actual or threatened breach of this Terms and Conditions would give rise to irreparable harm to PEAK for which monetary damages would not constitute an adequate remedy and, in addition to any and all other rights that may be available in respect of such breach or threatened breach, will entitle PEAK to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without any requirement to post bond, and the arbitration provisions below shall not apply with respect to the above. 

## GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER; JURY TRIAL WAIVER <a name="arbitration"></a>

These Terms and Conditions are governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of Maryland, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) does not apply to the Services or these Terms and Conditions. If you use the Services from other locations you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. If you take legal action relating to these Terms and Conditions or your interactions with or relationship to PEAK that for any reason is not subject to arbitration as provided below, you agree to file such action only in the state and federal courts located in Montgomery County, New York and waive any objection you may have to the venue or forum. 

Any controversy or claim between you and PEAK arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions, or breach thereof, including disputes with respect to whether the subject matter of any controversy or claim is within the scope of the Terms and Conditions, will be resolved by binding arbitration in Montgomery County, Maryland under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) and administered by the AAA. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English. Such arbitration will have one (1) neutral arbitrator if the amount in controversy is less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) or otherwise before a panel of three (3) neutral arbitrators. Each of the arbitrators must be i) a lawyer licensed to practice law in the United States with a minimum of fifteen (15) years of legal practice or senior level business experience or a retired judge with a minimum of five (5) years of service on the bench, ii) an individual with at least five (5) years of experience as an arbitrator, and iii) on the roster of neutrals of the AAA or similar nationally recognized ADR organization. If the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted before a panel of three neutral arbitrators, the panel shall be selected using the following process: Within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of arbitration, PEAK and you shall each select one person meeting the specified qualifications to act as neutral arbitrator, and the two thus selected shall select a third neutral arbitrator meeting the specified qualifications within fifteen (15) days of their appointment. The third neutral arbitrator shall act as the chair of the arbitration panel. If the arbitrators selected by PEAK and you are unable to or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. 

NEITHER YOU NOR PEAK WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO ENFORCE, DEFEND OR INTERPRET ANY RIGHTS OR REMEDIES ARISING HEREUNDER, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 

If any part of these Terms and Conditions is found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of remaining provisions. 

## ASSIGNMENT

You may not assign or otherwise transfer these Terms and Conditions or any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, and any such assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be null and void. The failure of PEAK to exercise or enforce any right or provision set forth herein shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms and Conditions set forth the entire understanding between you and PEAK with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written, between you and PEAK with respect to such subject matter.

## AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICES

These Terms of Use are effective as of February 22, 2019. PEAK reserves the right to make changes to the information, data, and Materials provided on the Services at any time without notice. PEAK also reserves the right to modify or discontinue the some or all of the Services, or any Materials contained or accessible thereon, at any time without prior notice. PEAK shall in no way be held liable for any consequence which results from PEAK’s decision to modify or discontinue providing the Services or any content or functionality thereof.

## MISCELLANEOUS

You guarantee that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. 

PEAK expressly reserves the right to monitor any and all use of the Services. PEAK also reserves the right to investigate and take legal action against any against any illegal and/or unauthorized use of the Services and/or Materials. PEAK’s decision not to pursue legal action for any violation of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any of PEAK’s legal rights.

These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and PEAK with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, and representations, whether written, oral, or otherwise.
