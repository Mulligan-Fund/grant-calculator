PEAK Grantmaking (“**PEAK**,” “**we**,” “**us**”, or “**our**”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information we hold about you collected through or in association with the website (the “**Website**”) or otherwise through your interactions with us (collectively, the “**Services**”). _Please review the following notice to understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you may provide to us via the Services. This notice may be revised from time to time, so please revisit this page often to remain fully informed of our policies_.

_By using any of our Services, whether by visiting the Website, or otherwise providing your personal information to us through the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the practices contained in this Privacy Notice_.

## 1. **APPLICABILITY OF THIS PRIVACY NOTICE**

This Privacy Notice is subject to the agreements, including our [**Terms and Conditions**](https://netgrant.org/terms-of-use/), that govern your use of the Services. This Privacy Notice is applicable regardless of the means used to access or provide information through the Services (e.g., personal computer, mobile device, telephone, point of sale, or any other technology or software known today or developed in the future) and to all users of Services.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to information about you collected by any other third party services, applications, websites, or advertisements associated with, linked to, or otherwise accessible from, the Services. **The information collected or received by such third parties is subject to their own privacy policies, statements, and practices and under no circumstances is PEAK responsible or liable for any third party’s compliance therewith**.

## 2. **WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

We collect a variety of personal information from and about you through the Services, including both directly from you and automatically as a result of your use of and access to the Services.

You have choices about the information we collect. When you are asked to provide information, you may decline; but if you choose not to provide information that is necessary to provide a service or feature, you may not be able to use that service or feature. For example, if you are calculating the net value of a grant, we will be unable to complete the calculation without information about you and your organization (e.g., salary data for different roles). As noted below in the section captioned “Cookies and Web Tracking,” it is possible to change your browser settings to block the automatic collection of certain information, but that may limit your ability to use certain Services.

Finally, we may collect data that is not considered “personal information.” To the extent such data is stored or associated with personal information, it will be treated as personal information; otherwise, such data may be used or distributed at our discretion.

**\*\*Information Collected from You:**\*\* When register through the Services, we collect your name, email address, information about your organization, as well as other information necessary to complete your request. We also provide fields for optional information, which you may choose to include at your discretion.

**\*\*Information Collected Automatically:**\*\* When you browse the Website, we use commonly-used logging and analytics tools to collect information about your device, the network you use to access the Services, and information about your use of the Services. This includes software and hardware attributes of the device, unique device ID information, regional and language settings, performance data about the Services, network provider, and IP address (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet). In addition, information may also be collected passively in the form of log files and third-party analytics (including Google Analytics) that record website activity. For example, log file entries and analytics data are generated every time a user visits a particular page on our Website, and track the dates and times that you use the Services, the pages you visit, the amount of time spent on specific pages, how specific pages are used, and other similar usage information, and general data (including the name of the web page from which you entered our Website).

**Cookies, Web Tracking, and Advertising:** We use certain technologies on the Services, including cookies and pixel tags, to personalize and enhance your experience on the Services, to collect data about your visit to our Services and sites upon which we advertise, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Services, and to gather broad demographic information. Cookies are small strings of text that are stored locally on your device that allow us to track certain information about your use of the Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is possible to change your browser settings so that it does not accept cookies (consult your browser’s “help” for more information about how to do this). However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain portions or functionality of the Services, such as our online booking functionality.

We allow third parties (such as Google Analytics) to collect certain non-personal information when you visit the Services. While we do not track your movements across the Internet (See the section captioned “**Do Not Track**” below), these third parties use tracking technologies to combine this non-personal information with other non-personal information gathered during your visits to other websites or when you use other mobile applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party pixel tag to collect this information.

**\*\*Information Obtained from Third Parties:**\*\* We may supplement the personal information we collect with personal information our partners collect or provide to us in conjunction with the Services, as well as from certain third parties that we have engaged to provide services to us, such as web analytics and usage information.

Additionally, if you choose to interact with PEAK or our partners on social media, such as by posting to our pages, tagging us in posts, or participating in activities, we may collect certain information from the social media account you use to interact with us, including the name associated with the account, the account handle, and other information that may be contained on your social media profile.

For the purposes of this Privacy Notice, “**partners**” means service providers, vendors, or other third parties with which we have a business relationship.
