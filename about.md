The Net Grant Calculator helps both not-for-profits and grantmakers evaluate the net value a grant will provide. For not-for-profits, the calculator provides a tool to help decide which grants to pursue. For grantmakers, the calculator helps understand the impact on grantees of application and management processes and helps identify ways to increase their grants' net value to grantees. It also helps grantmakers understand the cost of running a grant program to help identify ways to streamline internal processes.

We built the Net Grant Calculator to help organizations maximize their net grant values to help ensure as much net grant money as possible goes to program and service delivery.

## How to Use the Net Grant Calculator
To get the most value from this tool, you’ll need information about who in your organization is involved with different stages of the grant process and how much time they spent. If you don’t know exact numbers, you can use estimates and still get a good sense of the net value of a particular grant or program.

It will also help to have an idea of the salaries of people involved in the grant process. Don’t worry; we understand that salaries are sensitive information, and the tool doesn’t ask for names. But understanding how much time staff members are spending and the cost of that time is a key component in assessing net grant values. If you don’t know or don’t want to input that information, you can use industry averages, which the tool will help you fill in based on job title.
