		Grantmaking achieves its broadest impact when true partnerships unite grantmakers and grantseekers in service to the greater good. Based on trust and respect, these partnerships ascribe equal value to the experiences, resources, and needs of each partner.</p>

		<p>Grantmakers that respect the grantee experience rightsize the grantmaking process for the type, size, and/or previous relationships with grantees and implement flexible practices that consider that not all grantseekers bring the same resources to the process.</p>
		
		<p>Grants management professionals are at the nexus of their organizations and those seeking grants. They can implement practices and policies that build trust, redefine the power balance, and narrow the power gap.</p>
		
		<p>Board members and senior leaders at grantmaking organizations should commit to intentionally building power and capacity within nonprofit partners and to ceding space for solutions that come from grantseekers and grantees.</p>
		
		<p>PEAK Grantmaking calls on grantmakers to adopt policies and practices that shift grantmaking to a more balanced partnership for social change and give up some of their power.</p>
